# Farm Idle Game

Grow, upgrade, and master the seasonsâ€”build your farming empire one plot at a time!

Farm Idle Game is a relaxing and strategic idle clicker where you plant, harvest, and sell a variety of veggies, unlock powerful upgrades, and weather the changing seasons. Expand your farm, prestige for bigger rewards, and see how far your green thumb can take you!

The game features persistent progress, a prestige system, farm expansion, weather events, and a variety of upgrades to optimize your farm.

## Gameplay Overview

- **Veggie Growth:** All unlocked veggies grow simultaneously, each with a unique growth rate and seasonal bonus. Growth progress is shown with a progress bar, and the number of days required to grow updates dynamically with the season and upgrades.
- **Harvesting:** Click the harvest button to collect grown veggies and add them to your stash. Auto Harvester upgrades can automate this process for each veggie.
- **Selling:** Sell all veggies in your stash for money at any time. Each veggie has a unique sale price, which can be increased with the Better Seeds upgrade.
- **Farm Expansion & Prestige:** As you reach the max number of plots, you can buy a larger farm. This resets upgrades and experience, but increases your max plots and gives a permanent knowledge multiplier bonus based on your farm tier. Money above the farm cost is kept.
- **Plot Limits:** Unlocking new veggies and buying additional plots is limited by your current max plots. Upgrade your farm to expand further.

### Upgrade Details

#### Global Upgrades

Environmental upgrades and weather effects (Rain, Drought, Storm, Heatwave, Snow) interact with these global upgrades to further influence growth rates and harvest efficiency.

- **Prestige System:** Earn knowledge points for every veggie harvested (manual or auto) during the year. Spend points on permanent upgrades like Better Seeds. Farm tier increases your knowledge multiplier bonus.
- **Persistent Save:** Game progress is automatically saved and loaded using localStorage. Refreshing the page will not reset your progress. Farm tier, max plots, and irrigation status are all saved.
